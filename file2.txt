This is a new file.

I'm adding new lines to this file.

I originally added the file because one file wasn't enough.

I added this line and will put it in a new branch to try a pull request.

I added a line in the branch.  Hopefully this will be the last change in the branch.

But now it's way beyond that.  I made changes in a branch.  I'm making changes in the trunk and branch at the same time.
I need to modify both files.  This change is also in the branch.  TONS of changes!
That's the only solution.  I made this change to the branch later.

Changes in the clone.  This change was made after pushing a different change.

I continued to make changes in the trunk.  I made even more changes in the trunk.

A change to the file.
